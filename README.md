# Zero Numbers Game

## Search Algorithms in AI

this game done with flutter and the main purpose of it is to understand and use algorithms like:

- DFS (Depth First Search),
- BFS (Breadth First Search),
- UCS (Uniform Cost Search (Dijkstra for large graphs),
- A* Search Algorithm.
  
I used these algorithms to get to the solution to every level of the game and gave the player a hint when he stuck somewhere.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
